Thanks for wanting to add a skill! Here's how.

## Adding a New Skill

### 1. Create the skill directory

```bash
mkdir -p skills/your-skill-name
```

Use kebab-case for the directory name.

### 2. Write SKILL.md

Create `skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md` with this structure:

```yaml
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Describe WHEN Claude should activate this skill. Be specific about trigger phrases and use cases. This is the most important field - it determines whether your skill gets used.
version: 1.0.0
---

# Your Skill Name

[Instructions for Claude on how to execute this skill]
```

### 3. Skill Quality Checklist

Before submitting, make sure your skill:

- [ ] Has a clear, specific `description` with trigger phrases
- [ ] Solves a real problem people encounter regularly
- [ ] Includes step-by-step instructions Claude can follow
- [ ] Provides output format examples
- [ ] Lists rules and anti-patterns (what NOT to do)
- [ ] Works without external tools or APIs (pure text in, text out)
- [ ] Doesn't duplicate an existing skill in the pack

### 4. Test your skill

1. Install the pack locally
2. Start a new Claude Code session
3. Try 3-5 different prompts that should trigger your skill
4. Verify it activates correctly and produces useful output

If you touched the hooks, also run the test suite (CI runs it on every PR):

```bash
python3 tests/test_hooks.py
```

The slop pattern lists live in `hooks/slop_patterns.py` - both hooks import from there, so add new patterns in that one place.

### 5. Submit a PR

Your PR description should include:

- **What the skill does** (1-2 sentences)
- **Example prompts** that trigger it (3-5 examples)
- **Sample output** from at least one test run

## Writing Good Descriptions

The `description` field is how Claude decides whether to use your skill. Good descriptions:

**Do:**
- List specific trigger phrases: *"when the user says 'write a tweet', 'draft a post'"*
- Describe the use case broadly: *"any task involving social media content"*
- Include alternate phrasings people might use

**Don't:**
- Be vague: *"helps with writing"* (too broad - will conflict with everything)
- Be too narrow: *"writes tweets about dogs"* (too specific - rarely triggers)

## Writing Good Instructions

Think of the skill body as a system prompt for a specialist. It should:

1. **Define the role** - Who is Claude acting as?
2. **Describe the process** - Step-by-step workflow
3. **Set quality standards** - Rules and anti-patterns
4. **Show the output format** - What the result should look like
5. **Handle edge cases** - What if the user gives minimal input?

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful in PRs and issues
- Skills should be universally useful, not niche to one person's workflow
- No skills that generate harmful, misleading, or spammy content
- Keep skills self-contained - no external dependencies
